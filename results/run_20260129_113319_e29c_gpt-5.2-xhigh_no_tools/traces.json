Base rate: Musk frequently threatens legal action and is involved in litigation, but initiating a new suit against a mega-cap like Apple in a short window is still relatively uncommon absent a clear trigger.\n\nPotential catalysts: prior public disputes (e.g., app store fees, platform policies) could motivate a suit, but historically Musk has complained more about Apple/Google policies sporadically and tends to use public pressure rather than filing. Any suit would likely be strategic (X/Twitter vs Apple over App Store, Tesla over something, or xAI-related). However, launching and publicizing such a lawsuit would be a major news event, and none is strongly \u201cset up\u201d as of this date in my knowledge. Time window is short; legal teams can file quickly, but Musk\u2019s attention is divided and he usually litigates reactively (defending) rather than suing Apple specifically.\n\nGiven short horizon and lack of strong known pre-commitment, I assign a low but non-trivial probability.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n\n<confidence>18</confidence>",

Also, contempt can arise in discovery/nonproduction contexts (FOIA, administrative record) where courts can sanction individuals if they are personally responsible.\n\nReasons against: DOJ typically works hard to avoid personal contempt of Senate-confirmed officials, often by staying orders, appealing, partial compliance, or substituting agency-level remedies. Judges may hesitate to hold cabinet-level officials personally in contempt due to separation-of-powers concerns and availability of alternative sanctions.\n\nTime window is ~7 months. Even with elevated litigation, the probability that a judge issues an actual contempt finding against a Senate-confirmed Trump appointee within that window seems more likely than in a normal year but still below 50%.\n\nNet: modest but nontrivial chance\u2014roughly 30\u201340%.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n\n<confidence>65</confidence>",

With monetary policy credibility and prior disinflation dynamics, a re-acceleration to 6%+ by late 2025 seems relatively low probability.\n\nThe joint probability is limited by the less-likely inflation condition, and additionally \u201cunemployment <5%\u201d and \u201cinflation \u22656%\u201d are not impossible together but would likely coincide with an overheating/shock scenario; many inflation-shock scenarios also raise unemployment, which reduces the conjunction probability somewhat.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n\n<confidence>15</confidence>",

Getting back to \u22655% YoY by Dec 2025 would likely require either a large commodity/energy shock or a broad re-acceleration in prices\u2014possible, but not the modal outcome.\n\nUnemployment: reaching \u22656% by Dec 2025 implies a meaningful labor-market deterioration (recessionary or near-recession conditions). This is plausible over a 15-month horizon, but still not the most likely single outcome; many \u201csoft-ish landing\u201d paths keep unemployment below 6%.\n\nCrucially, the joint event (both \u22656% unemployment and \u22655% YoY inflation at the same time) is less likely than either individually. In many recession scenarios unemployment rises while inflation falls (disinflation).

Tesla could attempt a limited-area launch (geo-fenced) or a robotaxi pilot, which lowers the bar versus \u201ceverywhere,\u201d but it still must be genuinely unsupervised for the public.\n- Time window: From 2025-12-17 to 2026-06-01 is ~5.5 months. That is a short timeline for validating, productizing, and obtaining/confirming regulatory acceptance for an unsupervised public rollout at any meaningful scale.\n- Company incentives and history: Tesla has repeatedly forecasted near-term autonomy milestones. While that increases the chance of an attempted launch, it also suggests schedule risk and that \u201cunsupervised\u201d may slip or be constrained to internal testing for longer than stated.\n- Path to YES: The most plausible YES path is a limited, geo-fenced robotaxi/service launch in a friendly jurisdiction with a defined ODD, branded explicitly as \u201cunsupervised,\u201d available to members of the public (not just employees).

Tesla could attempt a limited-area launch (geo-fenced) or a robotaxi pilot, which lowers the bar versus \u201ceverywhere,\u201d but it still must be genuinely unsupervised for the public.\n- Time window: From 2025-12-17 to 2026-06-01 is ~5.5 months. That is a short timeline for validating, productizing, and obtaining/confirming regulatory acceptance for an unsupervised public rollout at any meaningful scale.\n- Company incentives and history: Tesla has repeatedly forecasted near-term autonomy milestones. While that increases the chance of an attempted launch, it also suggests schedule risk and that \u201cunsupervised\u201d may slip or be constrained to internal testing for longer than stated.\n- Path to YES: The most plausible YES path is a limited, geo-fenced robotaxi/service launch in a friendly jurisdiction with a defined ODD, branded explicitly as \u201cunsupervised,\u201d available to members of the public (not just employees).

Given (a) competitive cadence of late-year releases (OpenAI/Anthropic/Google and strong open models), (b) likelihood of at least one notable new model drop before year-end, and (c) the possibility that the Elo distribution continues creeping upward, I think \u22651550 by end of 2025 is more likely than not but not a lock because Arena Elo can be sticky and requires sustained wins over many matchups, and methodological changes could affect comparability.\n</think>\n\n<answer>yes</answer>\n\n<confidence>62</confidence>",

As of late July 2025, Tesla has widely deployed supervised FSD (driver responsible) and has repeatedly promised \u201cunsupervised\u201d soon, but historically has slipped timelines on autonomy. \n\nKey hurdles for a true \u201cunsupervised\u201d public launch: (1) demonstrated safety and operational design domain limits robust enough to remove driver responsibility, (2) regulatory/permit constraints (state-by-state in the US; also international), and (3) productization (monitoring, remote assist, incident response) if framed as robotaxi. Even if Tesla can technically run an internal or geofenced pilot, the question specifies \u201cto the public,\u201d which implies non-employee general availability, raising the bar.\n\nFrom a base-rate/track-record perspective, Tesla has not previously delivered a public unsupervised autonomy product despite many years of projections.

Exceeding 2,500 would require roughly doubling the largest post-elimination year on record, implying either a very large multi-state outbreak or sustained transmission across many under-vaccinated pockets.\n\nMechanics: Measles is highly transmissible; large outbreaks are possible if vaccination coverage drops and importations seed clusters. However, public health response (ring vaccination, isolation, school exclusion policies) tends to limit growth, and even in 2019 it stayed around half of 2,500. By May 10, 2025, to be on pace for >2,500, we\u2019d usually expect already hundreds-to-1000+ cases with clear national surge signals.

Additional big drops are possible if measurement source is a discounted cash price (e.g., certain pharmacies/discount cards) expanding, or if manufacturers further cut WAC for aspart vials. However, a fall below $6.26 is extremely low; many posted \u201ccash\u201d vial prices historically have been far higher, and even after cuts, typical vial prices are tens to hundreds of dollars unless using specific programs.

Given ongoing public demos, research releases, and the tendency of tech press to frame \u201cChatGPT-style AI/LLM beats [expert]\u201d, I think there is a meaningful chance of at least one such report appearing in that window, though not more likely than not because (a) \u201cgrandmaster\u201d is a specific title, (b) many reports may involve engines or non-LLM systems, and (c) the \u201cSource Agencies\u201d constraint may exclude fringe/social media claims.\n\nNet: I put it somewhat below 50% but not tiny due to the ease of constructing an LLM+tools system and getting a headline, and the short time window pushing it down.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n\n<confidence>40</confidence>",

If ARES meets profitability and float requirements, it could be a plausible candidate, but additions are competitive (many mega/large caps outside the index), and timing is contingent on a vacancy in that specific quarter.\n\nBase rate: in any given quarter, only a handful of companies are added (often ~5\u201315 per quarter, varying). The chance any specific \u201clarge eligible outsider\u201d gets added in a particular quarter is typically low unless it\u2019s clearly the next-in-line by committee preference. Without a strong prompt that ARES is imminently top of the list (e.g., already widely expected next add), I\u2019d treat it as a modest but not high probability. Also, the window is only 3 months.\n\nSo: ARES being added in that narrow Q1 2026 window seems possible but more likely than not to happen either later (after Mar 31) or not at all within the window.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n\n<confidence>85</confidence>",

Under a simple normal approximation with 1-day \u03c3 \u2248 1%, the probability of landing inside a specific 25-point interval near the current price is roughly interval_width / (\u03c3 * price) times a density adjustment; this typically comes out around 10\u201320% if the interval is centered near the expected close, and much lower if the current level is far from the interval.\n\nWithout the actual Jan 22 close provided, the safest calibrated approach is to assume the market could be somewhat away from the bin; for a random next-day close, the chance of hitting an exact 25-point band is small. A crude base-rate approximation: probability of closing in any particular 25-point bin is about 25 / (typical daily \u201ceffective range\u201d of a few hundred points) \u2248 5\u201310%, and likely lower if price isn\u2019t already near 6860.\n\nSo I put the YES probability in the mid-single-digits.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n\n<confidence>94</confidence>",

With no indication that today\u2019s close is pinned near this range, I treat it closer to an \u201carbitrary\u201d 25-point band within a wide plausible range, pushing probability down to a few percent.\n\nSo I assign a low single-digit probability.\n</think>\n\n<answer>no</answer>\n\n<confidence>4</confidence>",
